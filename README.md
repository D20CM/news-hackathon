# Happy Friday Hackathon!

Here is the hackathon outline:

- 1: Create an application utilising a news - API.

### Requirements:

- There are no constraints on what you can build, enjoy and showcase collaboration as well as languages/tools
- Example of an app could be as follows -> each column/row will have an article image, a name, a description and a button that will lead to said article.
- The code should be well structured and suitably commented.
- Make it responsive
- Testing ?

### Some ideas to explore as extra features::

- Have a login/logout feature
- Store API data in a database (10 - 20 articles)
- Have a favourite feature (user could favourite/like an article)
- Include dark/light mode for accessibility
